Git release should have already build last version of the program available for download and use, in that case you want to modify and build it yourself, here's a quick guide.

- Install pyinstaller, it's a py to exe convertor.
- create folder in this project, for example '_exe_build' and open it in terminal
- Run the following command to create exe file
```bash
pyinstaller /../run.py --onefile -w
```
- Use run.exe file however you want from dist folder
